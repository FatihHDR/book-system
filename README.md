This Bookshop Management System is a console-based application written in C++ that allows users to manage a book inventory. The system provides functionalities to add new books, display all books in the inventory, and modify existing book details. It also includes data persistence by saving book information to a binary file (book_inventory.dat) and loading data from this file when the program starts.

## Features
- Add Book: Users can input details for a new book, including ID, title, author, genre, and quantity. The system then adds the book to the inventory.
- Display All Books: Shows a list of all books in the inventory with their respective details.
- Modify Book: Allows users to update information for a specific book based on its ID.
- Data Persistence: Book information is saved to a binary file and loaded from it when the program runs.

## How to Use
Run the program and choose from the menu options:
1. Add a new book
2. Display all books
3. Modify an existing book
4. Exit the system
Follow the prompts to input or modify book details as needed.
The system will save changes automatically and load existing data when restarted.

Feel free to expand this system by adding more functionalities like book deletion or search based on your requirements.
